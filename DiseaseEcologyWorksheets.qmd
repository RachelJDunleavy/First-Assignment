# Sample Size for Disease Detection

![](images/ss_table.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    N=3/p=3/0.05=60

    n≥ln(0.05)/ln(1-p)=ln(0.05)/ln(0.95)=58.4--\>59%

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

    n ≥ ln(0.05)/ln(0.99)=298.07--\>299\

    b)  99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

        n ≥ln(0.01)/ln(0.98)=227.95--\>228

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
    \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

    N=4000 n=300 Positives found=0 Confidence Level=95%

    3/300=0.01=1%

    P(0.95)+K(0.95)/N=39/4000=0.00975=0.975%--\>0.98%

    Based on the finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \<1%.

# Measures of Disease Frequency: Prevalence and Incidence

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

Recovered elk are immune(not susceptible to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

6/12/25 I=5/51=0.098--\>9.8%/day

6/14/25 I=2/44=0.045--\>4.5%/day

6/15/25 I=0/42=0.000--\>0%/day

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence. 

6/13/25 P=12/56=0.214--\>21.4%

6/16/25 P=5/56=0.089--\>8.9%

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

P(06/10)=C06/10/56

I(06/10)= C06/10/56

These are numerically identical, so prevalence equals incidence on 06/10/25

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest? 

The lowest incidence is 0, occurring on a tie: 06/15/25 and 06/16/2025

# 10/14/2025 Tick Lab

Ticks are external parasites that can be identified based on their morphological features and more recently through molecular methods. Traditional identification relies on examining characteristics such as body shape, size, scutum (shield) patterns, mouthparts, and the presence or absence of festoons under a stereomicroscope. Keys for tick genera like *Ixodes*, *Amblyomma*, and *Rhipicephalus* are commonly used in diagnostic labs. Advances in molecular techniques, such as PCR and DNA barcoding, llow for more precise identification of tick species, particularly when morphological features are damaged or incomplete. The public health significance of ticks lies in their role as vectors of numerous pathogens, including bacteria (e.g., *Borrelia burgdorferi* causing Lyme disease), viruses (e.g., tick-borne encephalitis virus, Heartland virus), and protozoa (e.g., *Babesia* spp.). Because ticks feed on blood from humans and animals, they serve as bridges for zoonotic disease transmission, making accurate identification essential for surveillance, outbreak response, and prevention strategies.
