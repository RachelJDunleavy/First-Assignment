This image shows the connection between pathogen, host, and the environment. It shows that if one is present it is more then likely that the other 2 had a part in how it is expressed.

# 9/22/2025 Worksheet 2

# Sample Size for Disease Detection

![](images/ss_table.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    N=3/p=3/0.05=60

    n≥ln(0.05)/ln(1-p)=ln(0.05)/ln(0.95)=58.4--\>59%

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

    n ≥ ln(0.05)/ln(0.99)=298.07--\>299\

    b)  99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

        n ≥ln(0.01)/ln(0.98)=227.95--\>228

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
    \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

    N=4000 n=300 Positives found=0 Confidence Level=95%

    3/300=0.01=1%

    P(0.95)+K(0.95)/N=39/4000=0.00975=0.975%--\>0.98%

    Based on the finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \<1%.
