# Sample Size for Disease Detection

![](images/ss_table.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    N=3/p=3/0.05=60

    n≥ln(0.05)/ln(1-p)=ln(0.05)/ln(0.95)=58.4--\>59%

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

    n ≥ ln(0.05)/ln(0.99)=298.07--\>299\

    b)  99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

        n ≥ln(0.01)/ln(0.98)=227.95--\>228

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
    \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

    N=4000 n=300 Positives found=0 Confidence Level=95%

    3/300=0.01=1%

    P(0.95)+K(0.95)/N=39/4000=0.00975=0.975%--\>0.98%

    Based on the finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \<1%.

# Measures of Disease Frequency: Prevalence and Incidence

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

Recovered elk are immune(not susceptible to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

6/12/25 I=5/51=0.098--\>9.8%/day

6/14/25 I=2/44=0.045--\>4.5%/day

6/15/25 I=0/42=0.000--\>0%/day

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence. 

6/13/25 P=12/56=0.214--\>21.4%

6/16/25 P=5/56=0.089--\>8.9%

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

P(06/10)=C06/10/56

I(06/10)= C06/10/56

These are numerically identical, so prevalence equals incidence on 06/10/25

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest? 

The lowest incidence is 0, occurring on a tie: 06/15/25 and 06/16/2025

# 10/14/2025 Tick Lab

Ticks are external parasites that can be identified based on their morphological features and more recently through molecular methods. Traditional identification relies on examining characteristics such as body shape, size, scutum (shield) patterns, mouthparts, and the presence or absence of festoons under a stereomicroscope. Keys for tick genera like *Ixodes*, *Amblyomma*, and *Rhipicephalus* are commonly used in diagnostic labs. Advances in molecular techniques, such as PCR and DNA barcoding, llow for more precise identification of tick species, particularly when morphological features are damaged or incomplete. The public health significance of ticks lies in their role as vectors of numerous pathogens, including bacteria (e.g., *Borrelia burgdorferi* causing Lyme disease), viruses (e.g., tick-borne encephalitis virus, Heartland virus), and protozoa (e.g., *Babesia* spp.). Because ticks feed on blood from humans and animals, they serve as bridges for zoonotic disease transmission, making accurate identification essential for surveillance, outbreak response, and prevention strategies.

# Midterm Exam Makeup Questions

7\) In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safegaurds the Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.

The cause of this extraordinary mortality is due to Pasteurella multocida, a bacterium that Saiga antelope naturally carry in their nasal passages and tonsils. Normally this bacterium is harmless, but under certain environmental conditions especially sudden warm and humind weather, it can turn pathogenic. 2015, these unusual climate conditions triggered the bacterium to cause hemorragic septicemia, a blood infection that rapidly killed the animals. Due to the Saiga gathering in huge, dense herds during calving, once the pathogen became active it spread quickly and lead to deaths of over 200,000 animals in just a few weeks.

To prevent similar events in the future, the first step would be to do more extensive research and monitoring of Saiga herds and the environmental conditions that favor the pathogen. If we understand the biology of P.multocida, we could potentially develop a vaccine or targeted treatment. Vaccinating every antelope is unrealistic since they are free ranging, but random sampling, health checks, and testing vaccines on subsets of the population could help build herd immunity. Early warning systems bases on weather patterns and disease surveillance could also allow rapid response before outbreaks become catastrophic.

Finally, broader conservation strategies are needed to protect Saiga from extinction due to disease outbreaks. This could include maintaining multipe, separated populations so one outbreak cannot wipe out the whole species, protecting habitat to reduce stress and fragmentation, and supporting captive breeding programs as a safegaurd. These strategies would help ensure the long-term survival of the Saiga antelope even when extraordinary disease events occur.

9\) Define R₀. Estimate R₀ for the following scenario. Red flamingo represents an infectious case, and blue are susceptibles; an arrow indicates transmission. Explain your findings in the context of real-world wildlife disease.

R₀ is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious individual in a fully susceptible population. In the flamingo scenario, R₀=3 because the first infected flamingo transmitted to three others. This shows that the pathogen can spread quickly in dense wildlife populations. In real-world systems, such as avian influenza in waterfowl or colony-nesting birds, high R₀ values occur because of close contact, but once enough animals gain immunity or die, transmission slows as R₀ drops below 1.
